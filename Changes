Revision history for PURL

{{$NEXT}}
    - Abstracted the different checking / canonicalization
      behaviours into a PURL::Type base class, and a subclass
      for each supported type.  And use that logic when
      instantiating a PURL object
    - Added introspection methods "description" and "examples"
      to PURL::Type
    - UnTODO almost all TODO tests in test-suite
    - Add a test-file that checks the validity of all PURLs
      as given in the PURL documentation
